# Template p5 project

this is a prototype for the anyhting project, this code comes from
https://editor.p5js.org/RedHenDev/sketches/F1IPyLwj7.
My goal for this project is to create a mystery game where the player wakes up in the middle of a forest he doesnt know. He doesnt remember anything and doesnt know how he ended up there . He needs to deep-dive in his memories to remember what happened to him. The player will have to unlock certain memories by playing certain games and finding clues.
