Tim is lost in the woods and doesnt know how he ended up there. He dwelves in his memories to remember what happened.

Memory 1: tim finds a medallion in a parc while he is walking home from work, he sees weird things written on it so he rushes home to go make more research
memory 2: Tim is in front of his computer and as soon as he writes what was written on the medallion the computer shows a scary demon face and the screen is completely red, simulteanously someone is breaking into his home, most def the people he took the medallion from
memory 3: Tim is kidnapped and is in a basement, he is looking for clues or tools to get out and as soon as he does he hears footsteps and people talking. this is the last memory, nothing happens after bc now the user should understand why tim was in the forest in the first place.

I really wanted to make the game in a first person perspective, because I personnally like playing those games, you feel more invested and more like you are actually the character and you see what the character sees. It feels more personal. Without making it super scary, I still wanted this "glauque" and uncomfortable feel to it, the images and the sounds helped me create this weird vibe.
